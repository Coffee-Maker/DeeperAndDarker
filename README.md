Deeper and Darker
-
A Minecraft 1.19 mod which features more blocks, items, armors, and hidden mysteries to complement the new Deep Dark biome.

It also has an addon mod with compatibility features for popular mods in the works; it is still under _heavy_ development.

If you would like to help translate the mod and its addon, head over to the Crowdin page: https://crowdin.com/project/deeper-and-darker

If there's another language not already on the page you would like to help with, start a discussion on Crowdin. We'd love to make it even more accessible.
